Responsive Landing Page
Project Overview
This project is a responsive landing page designed to showcase an interactive navigation menu and several key sections including Home, About, Services, and Contact. The goal of the project was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and provides an engaging user experience.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content and defining the layout of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the page elements and ensuring responsiveness.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity and enhancing the user experience.
Key Features
1. Responsive Navigation Bar
The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page, providing easy access to all sections.
The background color of the navbar changes dynamically based on the scroll position, enhancing visibility and user engagement.
2. Styled Sections
The landing page includes four main sections: Home, About, Services, and Contact.
Each section is clearly defined and styled to ensure a clean and professional look.
3. Interactivity
The navigation bar's background color transition is smoothly handled with CSS and JavaScript, adding a layer of interactivity.

HTML Structure (index.html)
The HTML file defines the structure of the page using semantic elements such as <nav>, <main>, and <section>. Each section is identified by an id attribute, allowing for easy navigation and styling. The <link> tag includes the external CSS file, and the <script> tag includes the JavaScript file.


JavaScript Interactivity (script.js)
JavaScript is employed to add dynamic behavior to the navbar. An event listener is attached to the window object to detect scroll events and adjust the navbar's background color accordingly.


CSS Styling (styles.css)
CSS is used to style the body, navbar, and various sections of the page. Flexbox is utilized for the navigation menu to ensure even spacing and alignment. Smooth transitions for the navbar background color are implemented to enhance the user experience.
